# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for performing data analysis and visualization on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset that contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including whether they survived or not.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset (`Titanic-Dataset.csv`) is a CSV file that contains the following columns:

- `PassengerId`: Unique identifier for each passenger
- `Survived`: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
- `Name`: Passenger's name
- `Sex`: Passenger's gender (male or female)
- `Age`: Passenger's age
- `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
- `Ticket`: Ticket number
- `Fare`: Fare paid for the ticket
- `Cabin`: Cabin number (Note: This column has been dropped due to more than 75% missing values)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Requirements

To run the analysis script, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
